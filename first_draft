import random

# The meals list contains the names of dishes.


meals = ['Pasta', 'Pizza', 'Steak', 'Fish', 'Chicken']


# Uses random() to print out a dish from meals by using its index position
# between 0 and the length of the list. If the list grows longer random()
# will automatically adjust its new max.


print(meals[random.randint(0, (len(meals) - 1))])



# The pseudo-code for the print statement looks something like this:

# 1. Print an Item from Meals, 

# 2. Choose the Item by its Index position, 

# 3. Generate the exact Index position by choosing at random() 

# 4. an Integer between 0 and the length() of the list Meals.

# 5. Note: You need to len -1 because of the way index works in Python; otherwise you'll
#    get an "IndexError: list index out of range". That's because len -1 is in fact 
#    the very last item in a list index.
