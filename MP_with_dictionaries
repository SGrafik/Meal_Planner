# Meal Planner (using Dictionaries)

'''  This doesn't do any RANDOMIZATION. It will simply return the FIRST match based on user input.
The user INPUT absolutely has to match the 'ingredients' VALUE 100% or else it will fail to find anything.
This also doesn't handle any errors and will only display 'None' if no matches are found.
This can only search for INGREDIENTS - nothing else (yet).
This doesn't print out an ingredients list, etc., etc., etc. 
Much more work to be done. NOT very useful yet...  '''


# meals is actually a LIST of DICTIONARIES,
# each dict contains 3 key:value pairs,
# the VALUE of the "ingredients" k:v pair is in turn a LIST (to hold as many ingredients as you like).

meals = [
         {"dish": "Pasta Bolognese", "ingredients": ["pasta", "minced meat", "tomatoes", "onions"],
          "cooking time": 30},

         {"dish": "Pizza Salami", "ingredients": ["pizza dough", "salami", "tomatoes", "cheese"],
          "cooking time": 45},

         {"dish": "Rump Steak", "ingredients": ["beef", "butter", "mushrooms", "red wine"],
          "cooking time": 20}
         ]


# This is where we actually QUERY the meals (list of dicts) with a FOR LOOP by:
# iterating through all of each dictionary's "ingredients" VALUES,
# and then RETURNING (as it's a FUNCTION!) the result (formatted in a 'F string' because it's pretty).
# Oh, and I've added the "cooking time" because I'm fancy...

def meal_planner():
    '''  The meal_planner function asks the user for an ingredient via input.
    It then iterates through the "ingredients" values in "meals".
    Returns the FIRST positive result. Will return "None" if there's no match. '''

    ingredient = input("Please enter an ingredient: ")

    for i in meals:
        if ingredient in i["ingredients"]:
            return f'{i["dish"]}, takes {i["cooking time"]} minutes.'



# Here we 'call' the def FUNCTION into life. Since we call the function with PRINT the result
# that is returned will actually be printed on screen.
